# Shopping Cart

A simple shopping cart written in React with Redux.

## Notice

This is my first redux application, and I may have been a bit over-zealous with the architecture.

I could keep working on this for hours. I'd like to add proptypes and more tests, but I've already spent too much time on this. It's been fun.

Some project organization decision were made by create-react-app (like the flat `src` directory).

## Usage

I haven't really looked at deployment procedures from create-react-app, so I'm hoping that you're familiar with the tool.

### with Docker

from the project root directory:

`./start.sh` then `yarn start`

then open `localhost:3000` in your browser.

### with NPM

from the project root directory:

`npm install` then `npm run build`

then serve the `build` folder.
