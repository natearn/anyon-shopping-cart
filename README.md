# Shopping Cart

A simple shopping cart written in React with Redux.

## Notice

This is my first redux application, and I may have been a bit over-zealous with the architecture.

I could keep working on this for hours. I'd like to add proptypes and more tests, but I've already
spent too much time on this. It's been fun.

## Usage

!! I'm having issues with the build files right now. I would recommend running the dev server instead. !!

### with Docker

from the project root directory:

`./start.sh` then `yarn build`

then open `build/index.html` with your browser.

### with NPM

from the project root directory:

`npm install` then `npm run build`

then open the `build/index.html` file with your browser.
